Google Assistant action to look up callsigns, etc

Currently in testing to-be released as an official assistant.

The only feature at the moment is call-sign lookup. Our source for callsigns contains only US calls at this time but I'd like to update this in the future.

Simplye say 'Hey Google talk to Signals Everywhere' then ask to 'Lookup a callsign' it'll ask for the call using phonetics and reply with the details.

If you wish to use any of this code you'll need to create an Assistant Developers account and configure it to use webhooks. I'm using ngrok to host an external URL while hosting.
